description: |
  Deploy a ETCD, etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store
  that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a
  distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader
  elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure,
  even in the leader node.
